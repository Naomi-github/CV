## Skills

I work well under pressure. To do this I prioritise the workload and put in place a plan that I can successfully execute to reach a tight deadline.

For example, in a previous role due to circumstances outside of the team's control, we were working to a very tight deadline to issue renewal reports to clients at the busiest time of the year. I prioritised the workload for the reports that needed to be issued most urgently and then worked back from there. I gave myself smaller goals within the larger deadline. I found giving myself smaller goals to achieve daily gave me a sense of achievement and motivated me to continue, when the workload could feel overwhelming.

As the whole team was working under pressure and to this tight deadline, I found it was also very useful to be in consistent communication with the team, especially as I worked from home full time and other staff were in the office. This meant that if another member of staff was overwhelmed by the workload I could step in and help them get back on track. Whether this was  issuing some of their client reports or by answering more calls in a day so they had more time to get back on track. After this high pressure period my retention rate of existing customers was 81%.
